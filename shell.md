Deleted from my material when I was a TA. 


## Skill: Shell-1

Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a traditional user interface. It is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.

**The shell on Linux (sh/bash/zsh/...) & MacOS (zsh) is different from the one on Windows (powershell/cmd). Here we introduce something they both share. If you use Windows, use powershell**

**Follow TAs & Have a try** (5 minutes)
 - ls
 - `cd <a folder name>`
   - e.g. `cd ~/Desktop` 
 - `cat <a text file name>`
   - e.g. `cat welcome.md`

Upload a screenshot of using `ls` in the attendance quiz later.
